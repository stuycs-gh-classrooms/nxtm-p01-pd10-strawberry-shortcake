Cool things:

    I love how you named your variables, it's really clear what each does before i even saw the code it was connected to
    Class barrier looks really interesting

Clarifying Qs:

    can gameOver and roundOver be just one function instead of two separate ones?
    upgrades and stuff might be hard to implement, how do you plan on doing that?

Suggestions:
-Maybe you can put dead(isDead) as a part of another function instead of letting it stand on its own?
-maybe simplify some function names so it's not as long (ie. processAlienBulletCollisions is preeetty long)
